# Tanks

This is a clone of Wii Play Tanks made using the [Bevy game engine](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/). It's not a faithful recreation, but a reasonable approximation to the original game. It's not a full game either, only a proof-of-concept for how to make a game like Wii Play Tanks using Bevy.

This project was built using Rust compiler version 1.51.0.
